## Gameplay

Your goal is to drive for as long a possible, collecting as many gems as possible.

Driving off the road, turning, and driving through oil all decease your speed.

Fuel can be increased by picking up the color-coded fuel type.

Yellow lanes change your vehicle type.

- A/Left and D/Right to go left and right
- Clicking to the left/right of the car also allows to go left and right.

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, [Kaboom.js][kaboom.js]

Written in TypeScript, it starts off with three screens - a title screen, a gameplay screen, and a game over screen. With a great deal of encapsulation the UI and individual game entities & groups are all added to the gameplay screen.

## Optimizations

While there are no impactful optimizations remaining, there were more features that were planned but not implemented, from racing against a leaderboard via ghost cars, the randomized assets being seeded - to allow for a game-of-the-day - to additional sprites in general.

## Examples

This isn't the first nor last game I've written using Kaboom.js:

Flappy Bird: https://github.com/RascalTwo/FlappyBird
